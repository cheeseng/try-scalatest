You can optionally specify chosen styles for a ScalaTest run. ScalaTest supports different styles of testing so that different teams can use the style or styles that best suits their situation and culture. But in any one project, it is recommended you decide on one main style for unit testing, and consistently use only that style for unit testing throughout the project. If you also have integration tests in your project, you may wish to pick a different style for them than you are using for unit testing. You may want to allow certain styles to be used in special testing situations on a project, but in general, it is best to minimize the styles used in any given project to a few, or one.

To facilitate the communication and enforcement of a team's style choices for a project, you can specify the chosen styles in your project build. If chosen styles is defined, ScalaTest style traits that are not among the chosen list will abort with a message complaining that the style trait is not one of the chosen styles. The style name for each ScalaTest style trait is its fully qualified name. For example, to specify that org.scalatest.FunSpec as your chosen style you'd pass this to Runner:
